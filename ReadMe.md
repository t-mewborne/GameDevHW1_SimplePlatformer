In this assignment, you will be putting what we've learned in class into action for the first time! This is also a great time to experiment with unity features to add additional, unique game elements. You will be creating the first pieces of a platformer that must include:<br/>
Player controls<br/>
Collectable items<br/>
Enemies<br/>
Player respawn on death<br/>
Level completion trigger<br/>
Multiple platforms of different types, shapes, look (e.g. color or texture) or orientations<br/>
<br/>
Note that supposed malacious files were removed from this repository. As such, it may not run properly.
