In this assignment, you will be putting what we've learned in class into action for the first time! This is also a great time to experiment with unity features to add additional, unique game elements. You will be creating the first pieces of a platformer that must include:
Player controls
Collectable items
Enemies
Player respawn on death
Level completion trigger
Multiple platforms of different types, shapes, look (e.g. color or texture) or orientations
